When we landed back in Palo Alto Airport, my friend T-- plopped down her headset and clipboard and announced: "That was a great American day."

The morning had started like many others during the academic year: wake up before sunrise to drink apple juice made minutes ago with the juicer from the 80's and devour a mango, take BART to Millbrae and switch to Caltrain, and get off at---Mountain View, to hop on the Shoreline Shuttle and meet friends at Google for breakfast, T-- and her colleague V-- visiting from Atlanta.

We filled our plates (I totally didn't have Nutella for breakfast...) and then opened up a corner of a huge pilot's map to plot our day's course. "Where do you two want to go?" An innocuous question. "Oinkina, we went to Auburn last time for lunch. V--, is there anywhere you want to go in particular?" With little experience, we decided we would trust T-- to find us a scenic route and fun destination. 

At Palo Alto airport, we spent half an hour running through the pre-flight safety checklist, making sure that various parts that should move, moved; and parts that shouldn't, didn't. Finally, we were ready for take-off. V-- sat in the front and I had the back row to myself to stretch out and take fun shots.

Our destination was Willows, mysteriously poetic and idyllic-sounding. Without looking at a map, I'm still not entirely sure where that is, but it's North relative to SF. 

We climbed up along the coast, hugging Half-Moon Bay and tracing Sunset. As we neared the Golden Gate Bridge, we were given permission to do a Bay Tour around Alcatraz and swing by the Bay Bridge through Treasuare Island. We chugged North for another hour, through Napa with its vineyards and city, with Sonoma in the distance to our right.

After descending onto the 16 Willows runway, we parked the plane (pushing it into its spot, as one does) and headed into an adorable diner [TODO:name] famous for its pies. We ate a lazy, leasurely lunch, and split blueberry a la mode and chocolate pie before heading off again. 

Before we could takeoff, however, we pushed the plane to the gas station at the airport: "Shell Aviation." We ran through the abridged pre-flight checklist, and then it was my turn to sit in the front seat---and fly!

She announced confidently, yet soft-spokenly as usual, "You have the controls." I questioned: "I have the controls???" A three-part verbal check, she smiled, "You have the controls."

All of a sudden, there was a little metal box in the sky that had three humans protected from plunging to death simply by the control of a 17-year-old who had never even driven a car before.

It was terrifyingly empowering.

With no sense of how vehicles moved in response to controls, I accidentally overcorrected for every whim of the wind.
